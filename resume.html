      <h1>Summary</h1>
      
      <p>
        With over 15 years of experience at a range of existing systems and new ones of different
        sizes and levels of complexity, I can work on any Java or Go web-based system or design a
        new one of moderate complexity as needed. The best parts are owning a new feature
        (implementing every aspect of it), learning something new, and a good challenge. My focus
        is a back end specialist with broad and deep understanding of back end concerns.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Managers have provided feedback that my strengths include taking on any task given, taking
        sensible risks, and getting things done.
      </p>

                <br/>
                The purpose is to identify gaps between the requirements of new laws and regulations in each tracked
                country and the client's current processes. The client can use this information to determine how
                serious the gap is, and what has to be done to be in compliance by the time the new law comes
                into effect.

              Developed a food traceability system used by Canadian and American clients. The system is capable
              of managing food products from the field to the retailer, “farm to fork”. It is a SaaS system that
              can handle the needs of different kinds of food production, such as produce growers, livestock
              farms, and dairy farms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The clients can manage their products, print bar code labels for different purposes (pallets, cases,
              etc), record the movement of their products at different points in the distribution chain, provide
              searchable details of their business and products for consumers, and create their own branded site
              within the system. A client can have their users register in their site to enter data, such as
              product movement and  surveys, and get custom functionality for their particular needs.
            </p>

              My role involved taking the client requirements, and creating the necessary pieces for it to
              function. For larger sets of funtionality, the work was split among multiple developers, but
              generally I did all the pieces of a given functional requirement on my own. I also provided advice
              on how to implement a given requirement: what pieces needed to be created, how long it would take,
              how to do it in multiple stages if necessary, and suggest other ideas if the requirement seemed to
              stray too far from the platform design.
